## Problem

In the input file "input.txt " there is a long non-negative integer written on each line
(the maximum length of the number is 100 characters).

1. Read the given numbers as a "singly linked list" data structure
2. Return the given numbers in non-decreasing order.

#### ! Restrictions

2. 60 minutes are given to solve the problem

#### Extra conditions:
1. Hide data members in Node. Return by methods or properties;
2. Implement the LinkedList class with the methods: append, find, remove, insert, swap;
3. Try to do it through merge sort and bubble sort. Measure the time of each method.
